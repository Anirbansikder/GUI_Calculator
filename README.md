# Tkinter

Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.

## Installation

The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)

Running python -m tkinter from the command line should open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface, letting you know that tkinter is properly installed on your system, and also showing what version of Tcl/Tk is installed, so you can read the Tcl/Tk documentation specific to that version.

## Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import Tkinter

top = Tkinter.Tk()
# Code to add widgets will go here...
top.mainloop()
```
